## Suggestions
- We should first fix the inspector finding with the high severity.
- First of all we should block the public access on web service instance on port 20,21 and 23.
- Rigourous IAM policies should be enforced, as currently the CIS 1.1 (avoid use of root iam account) rule has failed.
- Other medium CIS policies regarding IAM should be enforced - for eg. setting MFA access, expire the passwords in 90 days, etc.
- Cloudtrail should be enabled for all the regions
- Enable S3 bucket logging
- Security groups (SGs) should be revisited and follow the principle of least privelege. For eg. SGs shouldn't allow ingress on port 22 or port 3389, etc.
- Web service instances shouldn't expose inbound rules for port 80 and 5000 from the internet.
