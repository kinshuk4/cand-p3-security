# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Add CloudFront in front of the load balancer.
- Remove public internet access from all the instances, and just allow Load balancer to connect to the instance.
- Add api-keys to the application using AWS secrets manager

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- No, only enabling VPC private endpoints would not prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No, applying the default encryption will not encrypt the already existing files.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All the changes done to improve the security, will revert and will be updated as per the cloudformation script we had.
