Here are somethings which are not good and should be improved:
1. The web service instance is open to internet with 5000 port open and that too http. If someone gets the access to this port and web api, they can easily read all the data in the open. So, better thing is changing the load balancer to use HTTPS and move web service instances to private subnet with port 5000 and http. Also, only load balancer security group should have access to web service instance.
2.S3 buckets - both free and secret recipe have no server-side encryption enabled - files were uploaded without encryption and all the buckets have block public access disabled. Also, the InstanceRolePolicy-C3 has s3 actions on any resource, which violates principle of least privilege. So, this IAM role could be used to access and change content in any S3 bucket in the AWS account.
