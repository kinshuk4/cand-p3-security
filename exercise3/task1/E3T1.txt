# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
AWS Guard Duty constantly monitors logs from cloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs. It mentions the IP getting attacked which it would have got by checking Amazon EC2 network interfaces, so it most used VPC flow logs to do that.
